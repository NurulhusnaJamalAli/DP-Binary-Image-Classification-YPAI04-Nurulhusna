# DP Binary Image Classification YPAI04 Nurulhusna
 This is an exercise to identify what kind of binary classification for Class 1 (Cat) vs Class 2 (Dog) classification by Nurulhusna (YPAI04)

This class exercise involves performing binary classification using your own dataset. You will need to choose two classes (e.g., Class 1: Cat vs. Class 2: Dog) and find at least 150 images for each class. After organizing the dataset into two separate folders, you will use deep learning techniques to train a model that can perform binary image classification.

## Dataset Source
 The dataset used for this project can be found here. [Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).

 ## Prerequisites

 To perform binary image classification using deep learning, you will need the following prerequisites:

1. Jupyter Notebook: It is recommended to use Jupyter Notebook as the development environment for this exercise. Jupyter Notebook allows you to write and execute code in a convenient and interactive manner.

2. Deep Learning Framework: You will need a deep learning framework to build and train your binary image classification model. Popular choices include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.

3. Image Dataset: You need to collect and organize at least 150 images for each class of your binary classification task. Ensure that the images are relevant and representative of the classes.

4. Python Libraries: 

   - TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the chosen deep learning framework)
   - NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
   - Matplotlib: For data visualization, including plotting loss and accuracy curves.

5. Machine Learning Knowledge: A basic understanding of machine learning concepts, especially binary classification, will be beneficial.

## Instruction

### Step 1: Choose Binary Classification

Decide on the specific binary classification task you want to perform. For example, you can choose Class 1 (Cat) vs. Class 2 (Dog) classification.

### Step 2: Gather Images

Find and collect at least 150 images for each class. Make sure the images are representative of the classes and are of suitable quality for training a deep learning model.

### Step 3: Organize the Dataset

Create two separate folders to store the 150 images of Class 1 and Class 2, respectively.

### Step 4: Deep Learning Model Training

Use Jupyter Notebook to build and train a deep learning model for binary image classification.
